### Why Tachographs and Driving Time Rules Matter in 2025  

The **European Union’s driving time and rest rules** are designed to prevent driver fatigue, reduce accident risks, and harmonise standards across member states. In 2025, these rules remain largely based on **Regulation (EC) No 561/2006**, with digital tachographs (DTGs) mandatory for all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.  

**Key reasons to prioritise compliance:**  

1.  **Heavy Fines & Penalties:** EU countries enforce strict penalties. Germany, for example, can impose fines up to **€90,000** for serious breaches, plus potential vehicle impoundment.  
2.  **Insurance & Liability:** Non-compliance can invalidate insurance, leaving your business liable for accidents.  
3.  **Driver Retention:** Fairly managed driving times improve morale, reduce turnover, and lower recruitment costs.  
4.  **Cross-Border Operations:** Consistent rules across Poland, the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), Germany, and other EU states simplify planning but demand rigorous adherence.
