### **### Understanding Germany’s Toll System in 2025**  

Germany’s road toll system targets heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and is **entirely electronic** as of 2025. Here’s what Baltic transport firms must know:  

1. **Which Vehicles Pay?**  
   - **Weight Threshold:** All trucks, vans, and buses with a **maximum permissible mass (MPP) of over 3.0 tonnes** are required to pay tolls.  
   - **Axle Rule:** Tolls are calculated per axle. Single-axle vehicles pay the base rate, while multi-axle trucks incur higher charges.  

2. **Toll Rates (2025 Expectations)**  
   While official 2025 rates haven’t been finalised, industry forecasts based on recent trends and EU inflation adjustments suggest the following **approximate daily toll costs** for a standard 4-axle truck:  
   - **Standard Rate:** ~**€0.66 per kilometre** (≈ €133 for a 200 km trip).  
   - **Night Discount:** A **10–15% reduction** may apply for driving between 10 pm and 5 am, incentivising off-peak logistics.  
   - **Environmental Bonus:** Vehicles meeting **Euro VI-d**
