- **Mandatory digital reporting** via the European Electronic Logging Device (e-ELD) and connected tachographs.  
- **Expanded toll networks** and dynamic pricing in countries like Germany and Poland.  
- **Increased enforcement** through cross-border police cooperation and automated monitoring systems.
