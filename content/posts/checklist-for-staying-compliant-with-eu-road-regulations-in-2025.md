This comprehensive checklist provides fleet managers with actionable, practical steps to ensure full compliance with EU road regulations throughout 2025. We’ll cover driver hours, vehicle standards, emissions, tolls, rest periods, documentation, and leverage technology – while highlighting opportunities to optimise costs through smarter fuel card and toll provider choices.
