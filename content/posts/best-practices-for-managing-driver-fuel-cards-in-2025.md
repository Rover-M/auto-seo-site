### 1. Choose the Right Fuel Card Provider: Beyond Basic Pricing  

Selecting your fuel card provider is the foundation of a successful program. In 2025, the decision involves more than just the lowest per-litre discount.  

* **Comparative Analysis is Key:** Don’t settle for the first provider you find. **Actively compare providers** specializing in European fleets. Look beyond headline discounts to evaluate:  
    * **Network Coverage:** Ensure seamless acceptance at major forecourts *and* smaller, strategic stops across Germany, Poland, the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), and beyond. Check specific partnerships with networks like Shell, TotalEnergies, Cepsa, and regional players.  
    * **Toll Integration:** With Germany’s *LKW-Maut* system, Poland’s viaTOLL, and Baltic national toll schemes (e.g., Lithuanian Road Maintenance Fee), prioritize providers offering **integrated toll payment** directly on the fuel card.
